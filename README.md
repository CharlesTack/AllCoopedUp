![Homepage screenshot](static/readme/images/indexpageoverview.jpg)
- Deployed project can be found [here](https://https://all-cooped-up-12274f373445.herokuapp.com/).

#### A note on the name
"All Cooped Up" is play on words relating to the site's purpose being to review co-operatively played games.  It also harks back to Covid-19 lockdowns where there was an large increase in the numbers of people playing video games together online whilst they were "cooped up" at home. 

## User experience
### Purpose
- All Cooped Up is designed for lovers of co-op games.
- The site has been deployed with a selection of reviews, but users are encouraged to contribute their own reviews to help other users pick the best games to play.
- Filters are available and easy to use so that users can specify a number of factors to limit the number of reviews being presented to them.

## Agile methodology
- Agile methodology is "a set of methods and practices where solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams" ([reference](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile-essentials/)).
- A project board was set-up to keep track of user stories. Each user story was assigned a 'MoSCoW' prioritisation (must have, should have, could have, won't have) tag. The board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/CharlesTack/projects/16).
- The project board also includes columns for bugs which are open and those which have been closed.
